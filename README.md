# TECBOT-Scouting-Sytem
This project lets us enhance the scouting experience by implementing a mobile application, along with a big data system that throws real-time statistics about specific teams.

Colorado folder contains the latest version of the system.

This project was meant to be used on the 2019: Deep Space season, contact me for further info on new seasons.
